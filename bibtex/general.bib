  abstract =     {Due to the existence of the built-in predicates that that
                  operate on databases, such as assert and retract, in the
                  PROLOG language, the management of PROLOG databases is an
                  important but difficult problem in a compiler-based
                  system. There are conceptually two PROLOG databases in such
                  a system: the Code DataBase (CDB), and the Source DataBase
                  (SDB). In this paper, an approach to the implementation of
                  the CDB and SDB in WAM-based systems is described, with
                  emphasis being put on the implementation of the CDB. The
                  method for the reclamation of retracted clauses used in our
                  approach is the reference counting method. At the end of the
                  paper, we briefly discuss how the predicates that operate on
                  databases can be implemented easily with supports from the
                  CDB and the SDB. Though the approach is mainly for use in
                  GKD-PROLOG-2 which is a compiler-based system, it can be
                  applied to other WAM-based systems with minor modification.},

  abstract =     {Indexing of Prolog clauses is an optimization technique
                  whose aim is to reduce the number of clauses to be tried and
                  avoid the pushing of a choicepoint. We describe here in
                  detail how indexing is implemented in a commercial Prolog
                  system for dynamic code. In BIM_Prolog, dynamic code is
                  emulated WAM code, so we assume the reader is familiar with
                  the WAM. The description of indexing for dynamic code is
                  thus in terms of generated intermediate code and the
                  implementation of this code is in C. We point out the
                  benefits of this approach and give some figures to support
                  the choices made.}

  abstract =     "This article proposes a structuring view of the area of
                  automated debugging. Nineteen automated debugging systems
                  are analyzed. Thirteen existing automated debugging
                  techniques are briefly evaluated froma pragmatic point of
                  view. The three underlying strategies are identified, namely
                  {\em verification with respect to specification}, {\em
                  checking with respect to language knowledge} and {\em
                  filtering with respect to symptom}. The verification
                  strategy compares the actual program with some formal
                  specification of the intended program. The checking strategy
                  looks for suspect places which do not comply wth some
                  explicit knowledge of the programming language. The
                  filtering strategy assumes correct parts of the code which
                  cannot be responsible for the error symptom. Assertion
                  evaluation and algorithmic debugging are the most promising
                  verification techniques. Some intrinsic limitations of the
                  checking stragegy makes it only a complementary, though
                  helpful, debugging support. The slicing technique should be
                  included in any debugger.",

  Abstract =     "We describe an extension of the first order functional logic
                  language BABEL which supports higher order programming,
                  including higher order logic variables. The operational
                  semantics is based on lazy narrowing and subsumes reduction
                  and SLD-resolution. General higher order unification is
                  avoided and a decidable unification is used instead. By
                  means of a syntactical translation, we relate the
                  operational semantics to the declarative semantics of the
                  first order fragment of the language. This provides
                  soundness and completeness theorems which give an exact
                  characterization of the expected solutions on the higher
                  order level. The class of potential solutions is program
                  dependent. For some programs, it is as powerful as the class
                  of $\lambda$-expressions."

                  machine} which has been designed to support a sequential
                  eager implementation of a functional logic language. Our
                  approach has been to extend a purely functional,(programmed)
                  graph reduction machine by mechanisms capable of performing
                  {\it unification} and {\it backtracking}. We describe the
                  structure of the machine and explain the compilation scheme
                  which generates machine code from a given source
                  program. Both the machine and the compilation scheme have
                  been formally specified. A prototype emulator of the machine
                  has been implemented in Occam on a transputer system. Future
                  work is planned for incorporating lazy evaluation and
                  parallelism to the machine."

                  programs are to be easily understood and easily ported. It
                  shows how this can be attained, without sacrificing time and
                  efficiency, by extending any WAM-based Prolog
                  implementation. Statistics are given for local stack
                  performance of a commercial Prolog system based on the
                  extended WAM architecture, and issues in the contruction of
                  a Prolog system based on the extended WAM are discussed.}

  abstract =     {If the Prolog built-in {\em assert} is implemented in its
                  most general form it requires a full compiler and retention
                  of the compile-time environment during execution. Many
                  programs do not need this much generality because they
                  assert clauses - often ground unit clauses - for only one
                  predicate whose functor, arity, arguments' types and
                  possibly even the arguments' values are known at compile
                  time. We categorize a family of these {\em simple clauses}
                  in this paper. Programs that assert simple clauses compile a
                  clause template for each predicate and generate a
                  clause-specific routine called an {\em assertive demon}. At
                  run time the demon papercopys and fills in the template for
                  each clause asserted. Assertive demons either replace the
                  full compiler at run time, or limit its use to clauses too
                  complex for the demon to handle.}

                  definite clauses with equality and primitive
                  atoms. Following an approach parallel to Andreka, Nemeti and
                  Sain, we obtain a sound and complete finitary calculus for
                  NPL. Our semantics uses 3-sorted structures to model time,
                  data and finite sequences of data. Keeping with van Emden
                  and Kowalski, we define model-theoretic and least fixpoint
                  semantics for our logic programs and prove them equivalent
                  to NPL-semantics in standard structures (similar to the
                  weakly arithmetic domains supporting elementary syntax in
                  Cartwright) and prove a least definable fixpoint
                  characterization of NPL-semantics in admissible structures."

                  PROLOG) in a simple, flexible, and mathematically
                  well-founded way. The language relies on a constructor
                  discipline, well suited to accomodate PROLOG with a first
                  order functional notation. On the other side, the language
                  uses narrowing as the basis of a lazy reduction semantics
                  which embodies both rewriting and SLD-resolution and
                  supports computation with potentially infinite data
                  structures. There is also a declarative semantics, based on
                  Scott domains, which provides a notion of least Herbrand
                  model for {\sc babel} programs. We develop both semantics
                  and prove the existence of least Herbrand models, as well as
                  a soundness result for the reduction semantics w.r.t. the
                  declarative one. We also sketch a completeness result for
                  the reduction semantics and illustrate the features of the
                  language through some programming examples."
