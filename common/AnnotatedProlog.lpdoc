Ciao allows @em{annotating} the program code with
@em{assertions}. Such assertions include @concept{type} and
@concept{instantiation mode} declarations, but also more general
properties as well as comments for @em{autodocumentation} in the
@em{literate programming} style. These assertions document predicates
(and modules and whole applications) and can be used by the Ciao
preprocessor/compiler while debugging and optimizing the program or
library, and by the Ciao documenter to build program or library
reference manuals.
