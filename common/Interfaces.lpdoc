This part documents foreign interfaces (or @concept{language
bindings}) to several languages and systems that are typically
available in a default Ciao installation (e.g., C language, emacs,
etc.).

Other interfaces (like @concept{Java interface}, @concept{SQL-like
database interface}, @concept{Tcl/tk interface}, etc.) are distributed
separately.
