This part documents some Ciao libraries which provide additional
predicates and functionalities that, despite not being in the ISO
standard, are present in many popular Prolog systems. This includes
definite clause grammars (DCGs), ``Quintus-style'' internal database,
list processing predicates, DEC-10 Prolog-style input/output, formatted
output, dynamic loading of modules, activation of operators at run-time,
etc.
