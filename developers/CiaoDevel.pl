%! module:
%    This is an informal Ciao developers and contributors handbook. 
%
%    It covers some topics that developers and contributors should be
%    aware of: coding style, code reviews, testing, preparing
%    releases and distributions, etc.
% 
%    This is (permanently?) work in progress, i.e., different parts
%    are in different states of maturity.
