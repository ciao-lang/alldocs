This part guides you through some very basic first steps with Ciao.

We begin with the installation instructions in @ref{Installing Ciao
from the source distribution}. The following sections assume that Ciao
is already installed correctly on your system. It is a good idea to
perform the tests in @ref{Checking for correct installation} to check
that Ciao is installed correctly (these are the same tests that you
are instructed to do during installation, so you can obviously skip
them if you have done them already at that time). If any of these
tests do not succeed please review the installation instructions.

We continue with a description of the basics of @ref{Using Ciao from
the command line}. We strongly recommend reading also @ref{An
introduction to the Ciao emacs environment} for the basics on using
Ciao under @apl{emacs}, which is a much simpler and much more powerful
way of developing Ciao programs, and has the advantage of offering an
almost identical environment across different operating systems.

For any problem during the installation or use of Ciao, please refer
to @ref{Troubleshooting} @cindex{troubleshooting} for common issues
and reporting bugs.
