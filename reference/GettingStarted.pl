This part guides you through some very basic first steps with Ciao on
Unix-style systems (e.g., Linux, macOS, etc.) and Windows systems.

We begin with the installation instructions in @ref{Installing Ciao
from the source distribution} (or @ref{Installing Ciao from a Win32
binary distribution}). The next sections assume that Ciao is already
installed correctly on your system. It is a good idea to perform the
tests in @ref{Checking for correct installation on Unix} (or
@ref{Checking for correct installation on Win32}) to check that Ciao
is installed correctly (these are the same tests that you are
instructed to do during installation, so you can obviously skip them
if you have done them already at that time). If any of these tests do
not succeed please review the installation instructions.

We continue with a description of the basics of @ref{Using Ciao from
the command line} (a normal command shell such as @tt{sh/bash},
@tt{csh/tcsh}, etc.; or a Windows command shell). We strongly recommend
reading also @ref{An introduction to the Ciao emacs environment} for
the basics on using Ciao under @apl{emacs}, which is a much simpler
and much more powerful way of developing Ciao programs, and has the
advantage of offering an almost identical environment under Unix and
Windows.

For any problem during the installation or use of Ciao, please refer
to @ref{Troubleshooting} @cindex{troubleshooting} for common issues
and reporting bugs.
